    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="descrip">The traditional Chinese buffet entr√©e inspired this creamy Chinese coconut shrimp recipe. It is packed with nutty and sweet flavors with hints of citrus that pair well with one another. The indulgent, silky smooth sauce is a perfect pairing with shrimp and prawns. Serve the dish over rice, quinoa, or even creamy mashed potatoes to soak up all the sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>12 oz coconut milk</li>
      <li>3 tbsp minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 tbsp fresh garlic</li>

      <li>2 tbsp fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 lbs shrimp</li>
      <li>1 cup toasted coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
